What are 9 key interface of Collection Framework?

	1. Collection
	2. List
	3. Set
	4. SortedSet
	5. NavigableSet
	6. Queue
	7. Map
	8. SortedMap
	9. NavigableMap

What is Collection(I)?

	1. If we want to represent object as a group of individual object as a single entity, then we should go for Collection
	2. It defines the most common methods which are applicable to any collection object
	3. In general collection interface is consider as root interface of collection framework.

Which concerte class implements collection interface directly? 

	Their is no concrete class with directly implements Collection interface directly. 

What is the difference between Collection(I) & Collections(C)?

	Collections is a utility class present in java.util package to define several utility method for collection object(like sorting, searching etc).

What is need for List(I)?

	It is the child interface of collection. If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity where duplicates are allowed and insertion order must be preserved, then we should go for List(I)

Which are the implementation classes of List interface?

	ArrayList(1.2 V)
	LinkedList(1.2 V)
	Vector(1.0 V)
	Stack(1.0 V)

What is need for Set(I)?

	It is the child interface of collection. If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity where duplicates are not allowed and insertion order no required, then we should go for Set(I) interface.

Which are the implementation classes for Set interface?

	HashSet(1.2 V)
	LinkedHashSet(1.4 V)

What is need for SortedSet(I)?

	It is the child interface of Set(I) if we want to represent a group of individual as a single entity where duplicates are not allowed and all objects should be inserted according to some sorted order, then we should go for SortedSet

What is need for NavigableSet(I)?

	 It is the child interface of SortedSet(I) it contains several methods for navigation purpose. TreeSet is the implementation of NavigableSet. 

Which one is the implementation class of NavigableSet(I)

	TreeSet

Differences b/w List and Set

	
List
Set
Duplicates are allowed
Duplicates are not allowed
Insertion order preserved
Insertion order not preserved

What is the need for Queue(I)?

	It is the child interface of Collection, if we want to represent a group of individual objects prior to processing then we should go for queue. Usually queue follows FIFO order but based on our requirement we can implement our own priority order also.

	Before sending a mail, all mail ids we have to store in some DS. In which order  we added mail Ids in the same order only mail should be delivered. For this requirement Queue is best choice.

What are various implementation of Queue?

	PriorityQueue(C)
	BlockingQueue(I)
		PriorityBlockingQueue(C)
		LinkedBlockingQueue(C)

What is the need for Map(I)?

	If we want to represent a group of object as Key, Value pairs then we should go for Map.
	
	Map is not child interface of Collection. If we want to represent a group of objects are key, value pair then we should go for Map.

	Both Key and Value are objects only. Duplicate Keys are not allowed but values can be duplicated.

What are various implementation of Map(I)?

	Map(1.2 V) 
	HashMap(1.2 V)
	LinkedHashMap(1.4V)
	WeakHashMap(1.2 V)
	IdentityHashMap(1.4V)
	Dictionary(1.0 V)
	HashTable(1.0 V)
	Properties(1.0 V)

What is need for SortedMap(I)?

	It is the child interface of Map(I), if we want to represent of some group of key,value pairs according to according to some sorting of key, we should go SortedMap(I).

	The sorting should be based on Key but not based on value.

What is the need for NavigableMap(I)?

	It is the child interface of sorted map, it defines several methods for navigation purposes. TreeMap is the only implementation class of NavigableMap.

What are some legacy interface and class in Collections Framework?

	Enumeration(I)
	Dictionary(AC)
	Vector(C)
	Stack(C)
	HashTable(C)
	Properties(C)
